# The tech stack:
## 🐳 Docker 
Containerized the microservices to ensure easy deployment and scalability across environments.
## 🐍 Django
Used Django as the main framework to handle the server-side logic and provide a reliable foundation.
## ⚡ Django Rest Framework (DRF)
Leveraged DRF to quickly build and manage RESTful API endpoints for seamless communication between services.
## Postgresql
  used as the primary database to ensure robust data management and integrity. 
## 🔍 Elasticsearch
  Integrated Elasticsearch to provide fast and efficient product search capabilities, even with large datasets.
## 🔄 Redis
  Integrated Redis as a message queue to handle orders asynchronously, offloading processing tasks from the main server and boosting performance.
## 🛠️ Celery Workers
  Utilized Celery for background task management, processing orders in the background for improved server efficiency and responsiveness.
## 📧 Email Registration & Verification
  Built an email registration and verification system to enhance user authentication and account security.
## 🔑 JWT Authentication: Integrated JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
  for secure and stateless authentication, ensuring smooth user login and API access.
It’s been an amazing experience working with these technologies, and I’m excited to continue building scalable and efficient applications! 💻✨
